# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Challenge: E-commerce Back End

## Description

This week had to build a back end e-commerce site. Was given a working Express.js API and 
instructed to configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. Testing was completed in Insomnia.
Link for the demo of this assignment is provided below. 

## User Story 

AS A manager at an internet retail company  
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies  
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a functional Express.js API  
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file  
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize  
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands  
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data  
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application  
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database  
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags  
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON  
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core  
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
